🧠 Depression Detection Using Emotion Patterns

A Machine Learning Classification Project

📌 Project Overview

Depression is a common but serious mental health condition affecting an estimated 121 million people worldwide.
Since human emotions can reflect underlying psychological states, emotional patterns may serve as potential indicators of depression.

The goal of this project is to recommend the best classification model that can determine whether an individual is showing signs of depression based on their emotion patterns recorded over two weeks.

📊 Dataset Description

We collected a dataset through self-reported emotional logs.
Each record represents one individual and includes:

Features

1) Gender
* Female
* Male

2) Emotion pattern across 8 categories:

* Joy
* Sadness
* Anger
* Disgust
* Fear
* Surprise
* Contempt
* Neutral

These emotion values represent the individual’s general emotional profile over a two-week period.

3) Target Variable

* YES — individual is showing signs of depression
* NO — individual is not showing signs of depression

🎯 Objective

To evaluate and compare multiple classification models and identify the model that best predicts whether an individual shows early signs of depression based on their emotional patterns.
